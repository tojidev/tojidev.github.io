                <p>The discussions at the CII Annual Session, held on 28-29 April, in New Delhi focused on the future of globalization, the areas where India can lead, and what needs to be done to achieve the goals. Some of the issues revolved around co-operative federalism, ways and means to strengthen the nation’s logistics infrastructure, the imperative to build the future of India, and the criticality of a robust manufacturing infrastructure for India to lead world growth, amongst many others. The sessions also highlighted the important role that the private sector needs to play in tandem with the public sector, to enable India to lead global growth in the future.</p>

                <p>The speakers opined that protectionism is not new and India should be able to build its global presence as its exports can be built up in a growing world market. India must internalize high standards and encourage digitization and innovation, it was stressed. Industry too must step up its R&D engagement. Currently, Indian companies’ expenditure on R&D is just 0.3% of GDP, compared to the 1.5% global average. This needs to be scaled up by a multiple of five, especially through partnerships with higher education institutions.</p>

                <p>India offers inclusion, openness and the liberal resilience required for global leadership, said Dr Naushad Forbes, Immediate Past President, CII (then President, CII) and Co-Chairman, Forbes Marshall. He reiterated the need for openness in trade, imports and immigration. “ Industry should not seek incentives and concessions,” but should work on its competitiveness, he said. Ms Shobana Kamineni, President, CII (then President - Designate, CII) and Executive Vice Chairperson, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, assured that CII would partner government initiatives, with the focus on competitiveness, international outreach, innovation and sustainability. Mr Rakesh Bharti Mittal, President Designate, CII (then Vice President, CII), and Vice-Chairman, Bharti Enterprises, introduced the CII Report on Ethics in Real Estate as a measure to strengthen the sector in alignment with the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016.</p>

                <p>Shri Arun Jaitley, Minister of Finance, Corporate Affairs and Defence, in his inaugural address, articulated the vision of a new India. While the globalization process is in a state of flux the world over with ongoing debates over its perceived challenges and advantages, we in India have no doubt about the benefits of barrier-free interaction with the world, he declared.</p>

                <p>Shri Jaitley launched the CII Centre for Arbitration & Mediation electronically during the sessions. He also released the CII Codes for Ethics in Healthcare and Real Estate.</p>

                Members of Parliament, speaking at the session, felt that India’s value system gives it an edge in leading the world. During an Interactive Session with Secretaries to the Government of India, Mr Pradeep K Sinha, Cabinet Secretary, Mr Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Ms Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary (Electronics and IT), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, expressed confidence that global restrictions would not inhibit the India growth story, due to the strong reform actions being undertaken by the Government. India has evolved from being considered a fragile economy to being recognized as a bright spot in the world, said Mr Sunil Kant Munjal, Past President, CII, and Chairman, Hero Corporate Service Ltd. The effectiveness of reforms would be seen over time, he added.</p>
